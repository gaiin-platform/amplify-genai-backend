// This is a simple report writing assistant using the StateBasedAssistant framework.
// Each assistant is based on a state machine. Each state can have an entry action that
// is executed when the state is entered. When a state is entered, it is passed a context
// that has the current state. The context.data is information that the assistant states's
// have stored, such as the outline for the report to write. Each time a state is entered,
// the assistant will execute the entry action for that state. The entry action can create
// and store new data in the context.data, update the status (e.g., the messages shown to
// the user about what the assistant is doing), prompt the LLM for some output, send output
// to the assistant response that the user sees, or run an arbitrary function. After the
// entry action is executed, the assistant will build a special prompt to determine the
// next state to transition to and prompt the LLM to choose the next state. The prompt
// includes the context.data as information in that prompt. Once the LLM chooses a next
// state, the assistant will transition to that state and execute its entry action. This
// process continues until an endState is reached. Each AssistantState can be provided
// a configuration that includes pre/post information to include in the next state prompt
// to help the LLM choose the next state. These are passed in the config parameter as
// {extraInstructions:{postInstructions:"will come at the end fo the prompt", preInstructions:"..."}}.

// The state machine is defined by adding transitions to each state with the addTransition
// method. The first parameter is the name of the state to transition to and the second
// parameter is the description of the state to show in the prompt to the LLM to help it
// choose the next state. Once the state machine is defined, it is passed to the StateBasedAssistant
// constructor along with the current state to start in. The StateBasedAssistant will handle
// receive requests from the UI and pass them to the state machine to be processed. The
// assistant needs to be exposed in assistants.js
